# Heart-Disease-Classification-using-R
## Introduction:
Heart disease is a prevalent health concern that affects millions of people globally. Given the rise of various risk factors such as unhealthy lifestyles, alcohol consumption, and physical inactivity, it is imperative to identify those who are at high risk of developing heart diseases. According to the World Health Organization(WHO), cardiovascular diseases are responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths annually, making it the leading cause of mortality worldwide. To combat this problem, this project aims to develop a classification model for heart disease using R programming. The primary objective of this project is to identify individuals at high risk of heart disease and to provide valuable insights and a better understanding of the risk factors associated with heart disease to prevent premature mortality. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to make significant contributions to the prevention of heart-related health issues.

## Data Description:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collected a vast dataset that constitutes a significant component of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). This system conducts annual telephone surveys to gather health-related data on residents of the United States.

The following is a description of a subset of the collected data:

| Variable name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `HeartDisease` | Respondents that have ever reported having coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI). (Yes/No) |
| `BMI` | Body mass index. (Numeric) |
| `Smoking` | Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life? (Yes/No) |
| `AlcoholDrinking` | Heavy drinkers (adult men having more than 14 drinks per week and adult women having more than 7 drinks per week). (Yes/No) |
| `Stroke` | Ever had a stroke? (Yes/No) |
| `PhysicalHealth` | In the past 30 days, how many days was your physical health not good? This includes physical illness and injury. (Numeric) |
| `MentalHealth` | Thinking about your mental health, for how many days during the past 30 was your physical health not good? (Numeric) |
| `Sex` | Are you a man or woman? |
| `AgeCategory` | What age are you? (13 levels) |
| `SleepTime` | On average, how many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period? (Numeric) |
